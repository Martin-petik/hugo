Hello! My name is Martin Petik, and I live in Halifax, United Kingdom. I am passionate about programming, website development, and working on translation projects. In my free time, I enjoy customizing my desktop environment, watching movies and films, creating games, running, and playing video games.  

I am a motivated individual with a strong interest in computer systems, Linux installations, cybersecurity, and programming. Currently, I am studying Digital Support Services, focusing on network security and technical tools. Known for problem-solving, creativity, and a hands-on approach, I am eager to apply my skills in real-world projects and collaborate with tech-driven teams.
